In the event that we transfer information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (which includes countries in the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), we will only do so where:</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">9. MARKETING INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>Upon signing up to, and continued use of Vow’s services, you agree to hear from us regarding marketing updates. We will send you relevant marketing information (including details of other products or services provided by us or other Vow companies which we believe may be of interest to you) by postal or electronic communication methods, including but not limited to email and SMS. If you change your mind about how you would like us to contact you, or you no longer wish to receive direct marketing material from us, you can simply unsubscribe from our marketing emails:</p>

    <p>We will contact you with information relevant to the operation and maintenance of your Vow account (including updated information about how we process your personal information), by a variety of means including via, email, text message, and in-app notifications.

We may monitor or record calls, emails, text messages, or other communications in accordance with applicable laws for the purposes outlined in Schedule A – Purposes of Processing.</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">11. FRAUD PREVENTION</h3>

    <p>A. manage and take decisions about your accounts;</p>
    <p>B. prevent criminal activity, fraud, and money laundering; and</p>
    <p>C. check your identity and verify the accuracy of the information you provide to us;</p>

    <p>Application decisions may be taken based solely on automated checks of information, for example from fraud prevention agencies and internal Vow records. To help us make decisions on verifying your Vow account, as well as transaction limits on your Vow account, we look at the information you give us when you apply for a Vow Account; including biometric data such as your photograph and/or facial scan, information regarding your location, age, nationality and/or citizenship and other information which enables us to verify your identity and perform a risk assessment for money laundering and fraud prevention purposes. You have rights in relation to the automated decision-making used in the verification process, including a right to attempt account verification again or contact our Customer Support team if your application is refused. We will also profile your Vow Account to assign a risk rating for the purposes of fraud and unusual transaction monitoring and unauthorized access prevention. The information we will use to profile you will include your age, bank country of residence, and status as a politically exposed person or otherwise.</p>

    <p>We will continue to collect and monitor information about how you manage your Vow account including your account balance, payments into your account, the regularity of payments being made, and any default in making payments, while you have a relationship with us. This information may be made available to other organizations (including fraud prevention agencies and other financial institutions) so that they can take decisions about you.</p>

    <p>If false or inaccurate information is provided and/or fraud is identified or suspected, details will be passed to relevant fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies and other organizations may access and use this information. We cooperate fully to the extent of our legal obligations in the prevention of fraud, money laundering, and counter-terrorism. If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud, money laundering, or another criminal risk, we may refuse to provide the services you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud, money laundering, or other criminal risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing, or employment to you.</p>

    <p>Fraud prevention agencies can hold your information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years. When fraud prevention agencies process your information, they do so on the basis that they have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity, in order to protect their business and to comply with laws that apply to them.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">12. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>By providing you with products or services, we create records containing your information, such as customer account records and activity and transaction records. Records can be held on a variety of media (physical or electronic) and formats, but they are primarily held electronically. We manage our records to help us to better serve our customers (for example for operational reasons, such as dealing with any queries relating to your account) and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Records help us demonstrate that we are meeting our responsibilities and to keep as evidence of our business activities.</p>

    <p>Retention periods for records are determined based on the type of record, the nature of the activity, product, or service, the country in which the relevant Vow company is located, and the applicable local legal or regulatory requirements. We (and other Vow companies) normally keep customer account records for up to six years after your relationship with Vow ends. Retention periods may be changed from time to time (or waived where deemed low-risk) based on business or legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

    <p>Where there has been no activity on your Vow account since it was opened, we may delete your data after a period of 6 months, as you will be deemed an “unactivated user”. If there has been any transactional activity on your account, we will maintain your data until you request that we delete it, unless we are obligated to maintain such data to comply with our legal obligations. We may on exception retain your information for longer periods than those stated above, particularly where we need to withhold destruction or disposal based on an order from the courts or an investigation by law enforcement agencies or our regulators. This is intended to make sure that Vow will be able to produce records as evidence if they’re needed.</p>

    <p>If you would like more information about how long we keep your information, please contact us at: privacy&#64;round.money.</p>
