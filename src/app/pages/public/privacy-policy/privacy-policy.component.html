    <p class="my-3">We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with
      our Services, including:</p>
    <ul class="my-3">
      <li class="d-flex gap-2"><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts. We
        may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep
        your account in working order.
      </li>
      <li class="d-flex gap-2"><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users. We may process your information to

        service.</li>
      <li class="d-flex gap-2"><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>email addresses</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="section-title">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

      following third parties.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul class="my-3">
      <li class="d-flex gap-2"><i class="bi bi-dot"></i>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
        negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
        portion of our business to another company.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="section-title">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p class="my-3" style="font-style: italic">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
      Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
      this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
      accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
      personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
      either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
      personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
    <p style="font-style: italic">In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and
      technical security measures.</p>
    <p class="my-3">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures
      designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
      safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
      information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
      guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat
      our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our
      best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
      Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
    <p class="my-3" style="font-style: italic">In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age</p>
    <p class="my-3">We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we
      knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
      18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s
      use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
      been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete
      such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
      under age 18, please contact us at <a href="hello&#64;tbga.group" target="_blank" class="text-primary">hello&#64;tbga.group</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="section-title">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
    <p class="my-3" style="font-style: italic">In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
      country, province, or state of residence</p>
    <p class="my-3">Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
      which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
      withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
      using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
      NOTICE?' below.</p>
    <p class="my-3">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
      nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
      in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>
    <h5 class="font-bold my-3">Account Information</h5>
    <p class="my-3">If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
      terminate your account, you can:

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-3">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
    information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to
    prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or
    comply with applicable legal requirements</p>
    <p class="my-3">If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
      <a href="hello&#64;tbga.group." class="text-primary">hello&#64;tbga.group.</a>
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
    <p class="my-3">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
      Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
      have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
      technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we
      do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
      communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
      we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
      Notice.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-title">9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>
    <p class="my-3" style="font-style: italic">In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
    <p class="my-3">We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
      updated 'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy
      Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
      sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed
      of how we are protecting your information.
